            <h1>The Art Of Falling In love by MarkoTheWriter</h1>
            <p>One day in a coffee shop, sat by the window a lovely young woman named Madison. She was a hopeless romantic who likes to day dream that one day she would meet a person by chance and fell in love. Though at that time she was just sipping her latte. A moment later, she noticed a tall, handsome, blue eyed young man was in line at the coffee shop whilst looking around the shop curiously. His name was Luke. After he looked around out of curiosity, he noticed Madison and approached her. They introduced themselves to each other and had a little chat. Madison started to noticed that she was catching feelings for him. Luke then invited Madison to go to a museum sometime and they exchange numbers. The next day they went to that museum and she noticed some more that she was catching feelings. They both sped more time with each other and unknowingly Luke was falling for her too. So, at a moment when they were both hanging out, he confessed and she too. They started their new chapter together and fell deeper in love. Then one day, Luke surprised Madison with a dinner date at the park, where later on he asked Madison if she wanted to marry him. A while after their planning, they got married happily and started a new family full of joy, hope, and love. They had a wonderful daughter together. But one day, Madison fell ill and passed away. Luke was grieving but he remembered all the memories he had with her, that helped him get through the sadness and a thought in which he will be together with her again one day. Luke and his daughter then continued their life with joy, hope, and love.</p>
