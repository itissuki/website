            <h1>Malin Kundang</h1>
            <p>In a village lived a widow and her son named Malin Kundang. Malin Kundang was a healthy, diligent, and a strong boy who usually went out to the sea to catch fish. After he went fishing, he would bring it to his mother or sell it in town. But one day, Malin Kundang was sailing and he saw a merchant’s ship who was being attacked by a small band of pirates. He helped the merchant with his braveness and defeated those pirates. The merchant was great full and thanked Malin Kundang¬ and as a repayment, the merchant invited him to sail together. Malin Kundang agreed and left his mother all alone. Years passed by, Malin Kundang became wealthy and had a beautiful wife too. While he was sailing for his trading journey, his ship laned on a beach near a small village where the villagers recognize him. The news of Malin Kundang on becoming rich had spread throughout the village until an old woman approached him. Turns out it was Malin Kundang’s mother, she went for a hug but her son denied her. Until three times his mother begged for the comfort of her own son, three times Malin Kundang yelled at her. Malin Kundang became undiligent and disobeyed his mother, he even denied her to be his mother. Because of his mother’s sadness and anger towards Malin Kundang, she cursed him and Malin Kundang turned to stone.</p>
