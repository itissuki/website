            <h1>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone</h1>
            <p>There was an ordinary orphan boy named Harry Potter. His parent’s death was still a blur to him. He lived with his uncle, aunt, and a bad cousin. His uncle’s family always treated him poorly. Harry was only allowed to sleep under the stairs and became sort of a maid to them. Though one day, a wizard came to send a message where Harry was invited to go to a place. Then on another day, a different wizard came to pick Harry up in his magic floating motorcycle to the mysterious place. Once they’ve arrived, Harry was in shock to see that there are many other magical wizards. Turns out, the mysterious place was a wizard school called Hogwarts. Harry then attended the school and became one of the 4 groups that the school had. The 4 groups were Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw. Harry was put to the Gryffindor group. Though his time at his new school weren’t all fun and laughter, Harry made a frenemy and his name is Draco Malfoy from Slytherin. At school Draco likes to pick on Harry. But Harry didn’t stop to get the feeling of curiosity of how his parents died and why he is invited to go to this school. He searched for a way and founds out that he is not just an ordinary boy, Harry is known to be the chosen one since he is a son of a wizard as well who seems to have an important role on something or a big history.</p>
