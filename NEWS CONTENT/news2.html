            <h1>Tennis: Venus Williamâ€™s record-extending</h1>
            <p>Venus Williams is a 43-year-old woman, ranked 407 th in the world, received a wildcard from the US Tennis Association to compete. Which means she will take part in a record-extending 24th US Open. She made her US Open debut in 1997 and went on to win the tittle in 2000 and 2001. Though after a six-moth injury, she returned in June and earlier this month she earned her first victory over a top-20 player since 2019. She did so by beating the world No. 16 Veronika Kudermetova in straight sets. Williams had to pull out of a tournament on the eve of the US Open because of a knee injury.</p>
