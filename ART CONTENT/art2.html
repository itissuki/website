            <h1>The Old Guitarist by Pablo Picasso</h1>
            <p>The Old Guitarist is an oil painting done by Pablo Picasso. This painting reflects a 20-year-old Picasso’s personal struggle and sympathy for people who are downtrodden, Pablo knew what it was like to be poor and nearly penniless. This art was inspired by Picasso’s fascination with the societal outcast that he saw while he was travelling through Spain. The meaning behind this beautiful artwork was an old, weak and poor man clinging to a guitar. The guitar was meant to be the only colour in the painting since it was highlighting the man’s only hope for survival. Like Picasso, the old man relies on the arts for his living but himself is living in despair and poverty.</p>
