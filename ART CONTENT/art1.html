            <h1>Maman by Louise Bourgeois</h1>
            <p>The Maman sculpture was stated that it was a symbolic of Louise’s mother. The name itself tells that the sculpture is called “mom”. The sculpture showcased the idea of maternal protection. Though the artist’s relationship to her mother was complex. The Maman sculpture is made as a resemblance of a big spider which has the meaning of a loving but complicated relationship that Louise Bourgeois shared with her mother. In general, it shows the complexity of the relationship between parents and children. Louise said that this spider sculpture is an ode to her mother since she was Louise’s best friend. She said that her mother is very clever like spiders. Spiders are friendly creatures that eat mosquitoes. Mosquitoes spread diseases but spiders are helpful and protective, just like Louise Bourgeois’s mother.</p>
