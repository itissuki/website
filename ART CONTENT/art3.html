            <h1>The Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dali</h1>
            <p>The Persistence of Memory painting is created by Salvador Dali. This beautiful artwork had a meaning where our subliminal unconscious mind is present in what we do daily and has more power over us than man made objects. In this painting there are meting clocks. Those clocks symbolize the lack of meaning and fluidity of time in the dream world. This painting represents a dream that Dali had experienced himself. The clocks represent the passing of time while someone is sleeping. The meaning behind this amazing artwork by Salvador Dali is the continuous change in time in the relation between the past, present, and future. The melting clocks in the painting have been inspired by The Garden of Earthly Delights painting, which was painted by Hieronymus Bosch.</p>
