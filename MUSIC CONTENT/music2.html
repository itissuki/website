            <h1>Shameless by Camila Cabello</h1>
            <p> Shameless by Camila Cabello had lyrics that showcased how complex emotions could be when someone is experiencing such feelings. Camilla was inspired to make this song because of a reflection of how she felt when her relationship with someone she loves was one sided. It shows that someone wants that person but canâ€™t have them. This song shows fearlessness and the abandoned feelings when they love someone so much thus making them willing to expose their raw emotions to the world. It also shows the lack of shame when they are stuck in a particular feeling. Overall, this song gives out a message where love is a powerful emotion that could make us go to extreme lengths. It also encourages us to embrace our emotions even if they are intense. Camila also wants to share that it is okay to be vulnerable and free to let our true selves shine through, and to live in the moment shamelessly.</p>
