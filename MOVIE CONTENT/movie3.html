            <h1>Ratatoille</h1>
            <p>In a city called Paris, lived a rat named Remy, he had long for his dream of being a chef. He likes to observe people in the kitchen while they are cooking. One day, while Remy was observing the kitchen like he usually does, he saw a newbie recruited. He saw him cook something and since Remy was curious, he went down to the kitchen and tasted the newbie’s cooking. It was so bad until Remy fixed it, but while he was fixing it the newbie, Linguini, saw him and decided to corporate with him since surprisingly Remy’s cooking was very delicious. They practiced a lot until one day, Linguini’s friend named Colette, caught them in action till they have to explain everything to her. Days went by, Linguini and Colette fell in love and cook together with Remy and continued their daily activities like usual. Then there was an opportunity to tell the world what amazing work that was done by Remy, but Linguini took all the credit and became famous, thus making their friendship a little out of shape. Linguini then apologize and the worked together again. One day, there was a very strict food critic who wants to try Linguini’s famous dishes. Linguini and Remy worked together to create a simple dish called ratatouille, though at that time the food critic had no idea it was made by a rat. But the dish made the food critic burst into happiness and made a great review on them. In the end, Remy, Linguini and Colette open a new restaurant called ratatouille. </p>
