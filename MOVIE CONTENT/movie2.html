            <h1>Ponyo</h1>
             <p>Once, there was a goldfish named Brunhilde. She had a human face and lived with her father, Fujimoto, who was “once human” wizard, and a lot of sisters. They all lived underwater. One day, Brunhilde wanted to escape but she got stuck in a jar and ended up at the surface by the rocks. At that moment, his father noticed she was gone so he went to search for her. Though Brunhilde was coincidentally found by a 5-year-old boy named Sosuke. Sosuke helped her out of the jar but he got hurt, she licked the cut and it magically healed. That made Sosuke shock in amazement. He then brought her to his mother, Lisa, in a green bucket while telling her all about Brunhilde on their way to the retirement home and school. While Lisa and Sosuke are eating their breakfast in the car, Sosuke decided to name Brunhilde as Ponyo. Once they’ve arrived, Sosuke told his friend and seniors about Ponyo, but one of the seniors freaked out. That made Sosuke scared and went down by the rocks near the shore. While he was there, waves came fast towards him and took Ponyo away from him, turns out the waves were sent by Ponyo’s father. Sosuke was very sad. When he reached home with Lisa, he put his green bucket on top of his fence, hoping Ponyo could find her way back to him. At that moment, Ponyo was already back with his father but she attempted another escape. Because she healed Sosuke by licking his cut with blood on it, she gained more power that allowed her to transform into a human. After the transformation, her sister helped Ponyo to escape but that caused a big tsunami. Ponyo then found Sosuke again and hugged him. Ponyo then stayed with Lisa and Sosuke in his house, but Lisa went to the retirement home to check on the seniors whilst Ponyo and Sosuke fell asleep. Found that Ponyo really wanted to become human and live with Sosuke, Ponyo’s mother, the goddess gave them a quest to test Sosuke’s loyalty. The next morning, Sosuke found that everything that was surrounding the house is flooded, even though his house was on top of the hill. Sosuke was worried about Lisa so he and Ponyo went to search for her with a small boat that was resized with Ponyo’s powers which made it big enough for both of them to fit. After they sailed the flood, Sosuke found the road and they spotted Lisa’s car, though there was no sign of Lisa. Sosuke got scared because he thought Lisa was gone, though Ponyo cheered her up and both kept looking for Lisa. Then they found Sosuke’s friend, a senior, and all three of them was captured by Ponyo’s father and was brought to the retirement home which was at the bottom of the sea because of the tsunami. Once they have arrived, Sosuke met with Ponyo’s mother and was announced that Sosuke passed the test. In the end, Ponyo was granted with her wish to become a human and be with Sosuke.
