            <h1>The Menu</h1>
            <p>There was a guy who is an expert about food, his name is Tyler Ledford. He went on an island tour given by Maitre d’hotel Elsa, with his date, a young woman, named Margot. Tyler’s original date was with miss Westervelt, who appears to have left him, so he found another date which was with Margot. They both went on the tour, who then met other people. They are Lillian Bloom (the food critic) and Ted (the editor), Richard and Anne Leibrandt (original guest, wealthy), a washed-up movie star and Felicity Lynn (personal assistant), business partners Soren, Dave, and Bryce, and Slowik’s alcoholic mother Linda. After the tour, they all sat down with the view of the kitchen at work. After a little talk from the chef, he presented his first dish to be served which was called the Amuse Bouche. The dish served depends on the chef’s selection. They all enjoyed it and moved on to start the first course called The Island. This dish represents the island surrounding the guest which tells that the chef is inspired by nature. After that, there was the second course called the Breadless Bread Plate. This dish had no bread just some toppings. After that, the third course. This course was called the memory because the dish represents the depressing memory of the chef where his father was an alcoholic and like to hurt him as well as his mother. The fourth course is called the Mess. This course explained where one of the chef’s cooks wanted Slowik’s life. Because of that, the cook shot himself at the throat. This course made everyone shock and shiver. After that, the guest was presented with a palate cleanser which was tea. Here, the chef explained that the guest are ingredients to a bigger concept, foreshadowing the chef’s intention of killing everybody. Then, there is the sixth dishes which is where everybody is required to go outside and the men get a chance to run and hide before the chef’s worker went to fetch them. After that, everyone went back inside to witness a moment where the chef made Tyler as one of his cook and asked Tyler to make a dish. Tyler’s dish turned out very bad and the chef whispered to his ear to end his life. Not long after, the chef called Margot, aka Erin, to do a task for him. Once she had completed the task she went back and a moment after she stood up and spoke. She said that she was still hungry, starved even. She asked the chef for a normal cheeseburger with fries, here is where the chef found his passion again and that made him happy. He let Margot go and the rest of the guest, including the chef himself and his workers stayed inside the restaurant and was burned alive ending the menu that was planned all along.</p>
